VPC is kind of being used quite often nowadays. It is easy to have us mixed up with Private Cloud and other Cloud-related terms, so it is great to have a quick summary on the topic and never need to get back and have a look whenever working on a project.

### What is VPC?
 
 Short for **Virtual Private Cloud**, private sub-section of a cloud server, such as AWS, IBM, GOOGLE, you name it and can place resources with full control and full access permission control. In other words, you rented part of the cloud from your service provider and providing with the space that you own within that cloud server, including the admin rights to control who and how to let in and go out.
