### Why do I start a blog?

I never had much of a habit of writing any kind of dairies, but as I work in a vendor environment for quite some time, I noticed that I forget most knowledge after picking up. when I joggle between project to project, which as a vendor, I usually do not have a choice of what programming language will I be using nor container and environment I am working in. Therefore, I could be learning something new (, but very shallow) from time to time. It allows me to get a very broad understanding of something very quickly, but as I only get to spend limited time on it, I forget most of them after I am done with the project. When I see a new project with similar technology that I have used in the past, I usually need to relearn everything from scratch, which leads me here trying to create a blog jotting down.

### What do I want to accomplish?

There are two type of goals that I want to accomplish. 
- First, note-taking of my knowledge. 
- Second, structural my thought with words.

Details as follow:
1. Note-taking from my work. I hope to have a systematic place to write my note.
2. Review of my week. A place to process what I have done this week, and review my work of the week to centralize my knowledge before my memory goes away.
3. Get my writing started. I find my writing skill is a mess, especially when I write my first blog. I cannot relate all my points together. My blog is poorly structured and written. I hope to improve my thought process and my writing skill.
4. Enhance my memory on new knowledge that I learnt from my everyday life. 

### What will I write in this blog?

1. Technology/Projects that I have played with.
2. Evaluation of some ideas that I joggle around.
3. Jotting Notes on Books/things I learnt.
