Hello, this is PC. I am hoping this blog could help myself having my notes being less unstructured and less forgotten. As working as a programming and data engineer, I find some of the skills that I have learnt were lost on the way, and it required me to pick up again as some of my earlier work were not well organized. Therefore, I hope by having this blog. It could not only ramp up my learning ability, but also the breath and depth as a systematic library will be created on the way. :)
